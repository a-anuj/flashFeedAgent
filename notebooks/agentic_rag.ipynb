      "LangChain offers a streamlined approach, enabling you to build agents with relatively few lines of code. Specifically, the documentation mentions achieving this in under 10 lines of code. This ease of use stems from LangChain's provision of a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations. This means you don't have to build the underlying structure from scratch or worry extensively about connecting to various LLM providers.\n",
